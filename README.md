> Stupid Simple Webhook Listeners

## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

It's a very rudimentary webhook listening platform that will display your `POST` requests to endpoints in realtime.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/listen-up; npm install
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Pull Requests

Sure. If you want to make it better. But really this is just for helping me test and deal with webhooks with work projects.
